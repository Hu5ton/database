## Introduction

### Why use Identity and Access Management with Autonomous Database

Autonomous Databases (ADB) can end up with a lot of users. There are some that have 200 users interacting with the database. That is a lot to try to maintain. With OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can use the power of Groups and Users withing IAM connected to the power of Schemas and Roles within ADB. The Roles and Schemas will grant privileges within ADB. If you then map Groups to these roles and schemas, you can now add Users to those groups within IAM and grant them the privileges they need to do their work. It will make both assignment and sign on for users who are already logged into the cloud much easier. It also helps improve security as you can simply remove a user from the cloud, removing them from the database as well.
